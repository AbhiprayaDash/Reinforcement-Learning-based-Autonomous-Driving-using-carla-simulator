# Reinforcement Learning based Autonomous Driving using carla simulator
 carla simulator is a urban based self driving car simulator.I am using an agent which will drive in the streets using RL based self driving.As the training time for the model is about 5-6 days on a very powerful GPU.so I was unable to train the model due to unavailability of such powerful GPUs for training.Training of this model can be done through drive.py file inside PythonAPI folder inside examples directory.
